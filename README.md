# üêß pingu

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hoffa/pingu.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hoffa/pingu)

I often work on the go through SSH, and like to know when my processes finish. `pingu` helps with that.

## Example

```Shell
pingu make
```

## Install

```Shell
curl -Lo /usr/local/bin/pingu https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hoffa/pingu/master/pingu
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/pingu
```
